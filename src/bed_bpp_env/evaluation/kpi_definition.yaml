"unpalletized_order_ratio":
  name: unpalletized_order_ratio
  description: This KPI can be interpreted as ratio of an order that could not be palletized.
  num: 1
  method: evalUnpalletizedOrderRatio

"volume_utilization":
  name: volume_utilization
  description: This KPI shows how many times the volume of the items is needed on the target caused by the pile of a packing plan.
  num: 2
  method: evalVolumeUtilization

"target_height":
  name: target_height
  description: This KPI represents the highest point of the pile of an order.
  num: 3
  method: evalMaxHeightOnTarget

"mean_support_area":
  name: mean_support_area
  description: This KPI holds the mean of the support areas of all items in a packing plan.
  num: 4
  method: evalSupportArea

"interlocking_ratio":
  name: interlocking_ratio
  description: This KPI represents how many percent of the placed items (except the first layer), are placed on either a single item with different orientation or on more than one item regardless of the orientation.
  num: 5
  method: evalInterlockingRatio

"stability":
  name: stability
  description: This KPI represents whether a packing plan produces a stable pile in simulation.
  threshold: 0.01
  num: 6
  method: evalStability

"eval_score_pal_ratio":
  name: eval_score_pal_ratio
  description: This KPI hold the ratio of stable palletized items below the height threshold divided by the amount of items in the corresponding order. If the packing plan produced an unstable pallet, the ratio is 0.
  num: 7
  method: evalScoreOrderPalletizingRatio
  threshold: 2.0

"eval_score_height":
  name: eval_score_height
  description: This method returns the height of the highest pile of a given packing plan, where all items that are not completely below the threshold are removed.
  num: 8
  method: evalScorePalletizingHeight
  threshold: 2.0

"eval_score_absolute_n_stable_pal_items":
  name: eval_score_absolute_n_stable_pal_items
  description: This KPI holds the amount of items for which the packing plan created a stable pallet and that lie below the height threshold.
  num: 9
  method: evalScoreAbsoluteNStablePalletizedItems
  threshold: 2.0
